# üê™ MACROSLOW SDK: Arduino Drone Guide with CHIMERA for QNN and Swarm Control
*Quantum-Enhanced Drone Programming: Mid-Flight Training, Agentic Swarms, and Real-Time MCP/API Path Moderation*

## Page 1: Introduction
Welcome to the **MACROSLOW SDK Arduino Drone Guide**, a comprehensive 10-page resource for building, programming, and controlling Arduino-based drones using the **DUNES**, **CHIMERA**, and **GLASTONBURY** SDKs from the open-source **MACROSLOW** library ([github.com/webxos/macroslow](https://github.com/webxos/macroslow)). This guide focuses on **quantum neural networks (QNN)** for adaptive drone control, **mid-flight model training**, and **agentic swarm coordination**, enabling **one-setup control of multiple drones** via **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **real-time API path moderation**. Developed by the **WebXOS Research Group**, MACROSLOW integrates **PyTorch** for QNN, **Qiskit** for quantum simulations, **SQLAlchemy** for data logging, **FastAPI** for secure APIs, and **MAML** for quantum-resistant workflows, all secured under **2048-AES** standards.

Designed for Arduino developers building quadcopters, hexacopters, or autonomous UAVs (using MPU6050 gyros, ESCs, brushless motors, and LiPo batteries), this guide leverages high-performance boards like the **Portenta H7** (dual-core STM32H747, 480MHz, MicroPython support) for on-board QNN inference and the **GIGA R1 WiFi** (1.6GHz dual-core Mbed OS) for swarm orchestration. Legacy boards like **Nano** or **Uno R3** can serve as lightweight flight controllers, offloading QNN and quantum tasks to a host system or NVIDIA Jetson Orin (275 TOPS). Drawing from proven open-source projects (e.g., **MultiWii**, **Betaflight**, **YMFC-AL**, **ArduCopter**), this guide evolves traditional PID-based flight into **quantum-optimized, self-learning, and swarm-aware systems**.

### Key Capabilities
- **CHIMERA SDK**: Quantum-enhanced API gateway with **QKD (Quantum Key Distribution)** via BB84 protocol, enabling secure mid-flight firmware updates and path commands.
- **DUNES SDK**: Minimalist MCP server for **MAML-encoded flight logs** and sensor fusion, supporting real-time data validation with **Reverse Markdown (.mu)**.
- **GLASTONBURY SDK**: AI-driven robotics suite with **VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)** for trajectory optimization and **BELUGA Agent** for multi-sensor fusion (LIDAR, SONAR, IMU).
- **Agentic Swarms**: One Arduino (e.g., GIGA R1) acts as **swarm leader**, using **MCP** to broadcast context-aware commands to follower drones via **FastAPI** and **NRF24L01/WiFi mesh**.
- **Mid-Flight QNN Training**: PyTorch models retrain on live sensor data, adapting to wind, payload changes, or damage in <2 seconds.

### Target Applications
- **DePIN Drone Networks**: Decentralized delivery, surveillance, and mapping.
- **ARACHNID Integration**: Quantum-hydraulic landing systems for Starship-scale missions.
- **GalaxyCraft MMO**: Drone swarms as in-game NPCs with qubit-based decision logic.
