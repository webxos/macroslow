# 🐪 CamelCase Quantum Study Guide – Page 10

## Conclusion: The Camel Is the Quantum

You began with a single hump.  
You end with an **entire desert of precision**.

From `applyHadamard` to `executeVqe`, from Dune to Otrac, from prompt to circuit—**every capital letter was a contract**.  
A contract between you and the machine.  
Between human intent and qubit fidelity.  
Between chaos and convergence.

This is not style.  
This is **quantum discipline**.

### The Final Truth

> **In the noise of superposition, only clarity survives.**  
> **CamelCase is that clarity.**

It is:
- **Self-documenting** — `createGhZState` needs no comment  
- **Prompt-perfect** — LLMs obey humps, not underscores  
- **Visually traceable** — Otrac lights up every capital  
- **Enforced at birth** — `dune`, `camel-lint`, CI, `ppx`  
- **Future-proof** — From OCaml to Goose to Qiskit to whatever comes next
