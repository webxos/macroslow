## Page 1: Introduction to Qubit Systems and Quantum Model Context Protocol

### What Are Qubit Systems and MCP?
Qubit systems leverage quantum bits (qubits) that exist in superposition, entanglement, and measurement states, enabling exponential computational power over classical bits. The **Quantum Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, a core component of **PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES**, is a standardized interface for AI agents to query quantum resources securely. Unlike classical bilinear AI (input-output), MCP enables **quadralinear processing**‚Äîhandling context, intent, environment, and history simultaneously‚Äîusing quantum logic, **Qiskit** for quantum circuits, and **PyTorch** for AI workflows. Secured with **2048-bit AES-equivalent encryption** and **CRYSTALS-Dilithium**, MCP orchestrates workflows via **.MAML.ml** files, making it ideal for applications like cybersecurity, healthcare (via **GLASTONBURY 2048**), and space exploration (via **PROJECT ARACHNID**).

### Why Linux and KDE?
A KDE-based Linux system, with its lightweight **Plasma desktop** and robust CLI, is ideal for quantum development due to its flexibility, open-source ecosystem, and support for NVIDIA CUDA drivers. The Linux kernel provides low-level control for optimizing quantum hardware interactions, while tools like **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** streamline development. This guide assumes a KDE-based distribution (e.g., KDE Neon, Kubuntu, or Fedora KDE) and focuses on integrating quantum tools with Linux kernel development.

### Objectives
- Set up a KDE Linux environment for quantum computing and MCP development.
- Configure the Linux kernel for quantum hardware optimization.
- Develop and deploy qubit-based workflows using **PROJECT DUNES** SDKs.
- Leverage **MAML**, **CHIMERA**, and **GLASTONBURY** for secure, quantum-enhanced applications.
