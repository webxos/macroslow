## PAGE 3: WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION – EXECUTING MAML-CENTRIC QUANTUM TASKS ACROSS USB-CONFINED SDK INSTANCES

With the architectural topology secured on the NAND flash substrate, Page 3 shifts focus to the dynamic orchestration of workflows that breathe life into the USB workstation. At the heart of this orchestration lies the Markdown as Medium Language (MAML) protocol, which transforms static documents into executable, self-validating containers that traverse DUNES, CHIMERA, and GLASTONBURY without ever leaving the encrypted boundaries of the drive. This page details the end-to-end lifecycle of a MAML workflow—from instantiation on the USB root to completion in medical diagnostics or space engineering simulations—emphasizing zero-trust execution, quantum-resistant signing, and host-agnostic portability.

A MAML workflow begins with the creation of a .maml.md file in the DUNES zone’s workflows directory. This file is not a passive artifact but an active agent that declares its intent, context, input schema, and code blocks in structured Markdown. The front matter YAML specifies encryption mode—256-bit for lightweight field operations or 512-bit for high-assurance scenarios—and includes a unique URN identifier tied to the USB controller’s hardware signature. Upon insertion into a host, the DUNES MCP server detects the new file via inotify-style polling of the exFAT partition and immediately subjects it to a three-phase validation pipeline.

Phase one is syntactic validation, performed by the MARKUP agent embedded in DUNES. The agent parses the YAML front matter and Markdown sections, ensuring compliance with the MAML schema. Any deviation—such as a missing permissions block or malformed code fence—triggers the generation of a .mu receipt file in the adjacent metadata plane. This receipt mirrors the original content in reverse syntax, enabling bitwise comparison to detect corruption introduced during NAND writes. If validation fails, the workflow is quarantined in a sandboxed block range, and a shutdown script is auto-generated to rollback any partial state changes, preserving drive integrity.

Upon successful syntactic clearance, phase two engages CHIMERA’s security heads for cryptographic and semantic verification. HEAD_1 derives a 512-bit session key from the hardware-bound vault and re-encrypts the entire MAML document in memory, producing a transient 2048-bit equivalent envelope. HEAD_2 simultaneously executes a Qiskit-based quantum circuit that entangles the document’s hash with a local randomness beacon derived from the USB crystal oscillator’s jitter. This entanglement serves as a one-time quantum signature, resistant to cloning attacks even if an adversary gains physical access to the drive. HEAD_3 runs a PyTorch model trained on known prompt injection patterns, scanning the intent and context sections for adversarial instructions. Only if all three heads concur is a signed execution ticket appended to the document’s history section.

Phase three routes the validated MAML file to its target SDK based on the type field in the front matter. For medical use cases, GLASTONBURY assumes control, mapping the workflow to its four-mode architecture: Fortran 256-AES for raw biometric input, C64 512-AES for pattern recognition in ECG waveforms, Amoeba 1024-AES for distributed storage of longitudinal patient records, and Connection Machine 2048-AES for billing integration with donor reputation wallets. The workflow executes in a sandboxed Python environment provisioned from the DUNES zone, with SQLAlchemy managing a transient in-memory database that mirrors to NAND only at workflow checkpoints. This minimizes write amplification while ensuring crash consistency.

In space engineering scenarios, the same MAML document may target CHIMERA directly for trajectory optimization. The code block contains a Qiskit variational quantum eigensolver that minimizes fuel expenditure for a triple-stacked Starship launch. CHIMERA’s HEAD_4 accelerates the classical optimization loop using emulated CUDA kernels, achieving convergence in under two hundred milliseconds despite the USB interface bottleneck. Intermediate states are journaled to the data hive in GLASTONBURY’s outer ring, encrypted at 512-bit depth, allowing resumption after host power cycles common in remote launch facilities.

Cross-SDK workflows are orchestrated via the shared Merkle tree in the metadata plane. A medical diagnostic that detects arrhythmia may spawn a subsidiary space engineering task to deploy an emergency HVAC unit to a high-risk patient habitat. DUNES brokers this handoff by updating the parent MAML’s history with a child URN, then signaling CHIMERA to instantiate a new document inheriting the parent’s permissions. The child workflow executes independently but inherits the parent’s quantum signature, ensuring end-to-end traceability. Upon completion, both workflows converge in GLASTONBURY’s visualization module, which renders a unified report in Markdown format, complete with embedded base64-encoded plots generated from Plotly canvases stored in the NAND cache.

Error handling is woven into every transition. If a NAND block fails during execution—detected via the controller’s ECC counters—CHIMERA’s quadra-segment regeneration activates immediately. The failing block’s data is reconstructed from parity shards distributed across the other three heads, then rewritten to a fresh block identified by the wear-leveling map. The MAML document’s history is updated with a regeneration event, signed by all four heads, providing an immutable audit trail. For medical compliance, this trail satisfies requirements for tamper-evidence, while in space engineering, it documents hardware reliability for post-mission analysis.

Performance is optimized through aggressive caching and prefetching. The DUNES server pre-loads the twenty most recent MAML files into the host’s page cache upon drive mount, using madvise hints to prioritize sequential access patterns typical of workflow execution. CHIMERA’s heads operate in pipeline parallelism: while HEAD_1 validates the next document, HEAD_3 processes the current one’s AI workload. GLASTONBURY’s data hive employs Fibonacci partitioning to co-locate related records—such as a patient’s biometric stream and the corresponding diagnostic model—within the same NAND plane, reducing plane-switching overheads that dominate USB 3.0 latency profiles.

The orchestration layer concludes with a graceful shutdown sequence triggered by workflow completion or drive ejection. DUNES flushes all in-memory state to NAND in full-page writes, updates the Merkle tree root, and encrypts the superblock with a final 2048-bit seal. A .mu receipt is generated for the entire session, mirroring every executed MAML document in reverse order, and stored in a dedicated receipt vault. This vault enables forensic reconstruction: by comparing forward and reverse hashes, investigators can verify that no unauthorized modifications occurred during the session, a capability essential for medical legal proceedings or space mission incident reviews.

Page 3 thus illuminates the living pulse of the USB workstation—how MAML workflows flow seamlessly from NAND pages to quantum circuits and back, secured at every step by CHIMERA’s heads and enriched by GLASTONBURY’s domain intelligence. The mechanisms described here form the operational core that the remaining seven pages will extend into specialized medical and space engineering configurations, each building upon this robust, portable foundation.
