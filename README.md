## DUNES 2048-AES SDK: The Minimalist SDK 
![Alt text](https://github.com/webxos/macroslow/blob/main/assets/duneslogo.jpeg)

DUNES serves as the baseline minimalist SDK. DUNES offers a set of 10 core files for building a hybrid Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with MAML processing and MARKUP Agent functionality. It enables quantum-distributed workflows with verifiable OCaml-based algorithms, hybrid multi-language orchestration (Python, Qiskit), and integration with MCP servers.

## CHIMERA 2048-AES SDK: A Qubit ready SDK!

CHIMERA 2048 is a quantum-enhanced, maximum-security API gateway for MCP servers, powered by NVIDIA’s advanced GPUs. Featuring four CHIMERA HEADS—each a self-regenerative, CUDA-accelerated core with 512-bit AES encryption—it forms a 2048-bit AES-equivalent security layer. 

Hybrid Cores: Two heads run Qiskit for quantum circuits (<150ms latency), and two use PyTorch for AI training/inference (up to 15 TFLOPS).
Quadra-Segment Regeneration: Rebuilds compromised heads in <5s using CUDA-accelerated data redistribution.

MAML Integration: Processes .maml.md files as executable workflows, combining Python, Qiskit, OCaml, and SQL with formal verification via Ortac.
Security: Combines 2048-bit AES-equivalent encryption, CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures, lightweight double tracing, and self-healing mechanisms.
NVIDIA Optimization: Achieves 76x training speedup, 4.2x inference speed, and 12.8 TFLOPS for quantum simulations and video processing.

CHIMERA 2048 supports scientific research, AI development, security monitoring, and data science, with deployment via Kubernetes/Helm and monitoring through Prometheus.

## GLASTONBURY 2048-AES Suite SDK
The GLASTONBURY 2048 Suite SDK is a qubit based medical and science research library that accelerates AI-driven robotics and quantum workflows, leveraging NVIDIA’s Jetson Orin and Isaac Sim.

MAML Scripting: Routes tasks via MCP to CHIMERA’s four-headed architecture (authentication, computation, visualization, storage).
PyTorch/SQLAlchemy: Optimizes neural networks and manages sensor data for real-time control.
NVIDIA CUDA: Accelerates Qiskit simulations for trajectory and cooling optimization in ARACHNID and other applications.
Applications: Autonomous navigation, robotic arm manipulation, and humanoid skill learning, optimized for CUDA-enabled GPUs.


## DRONE SOFTWARE: Qubit based Drone Software

PROJECT ARACHNID, the Rooster Booster, is a quantum-powered rocket booster system designed to enhance SpaceX’s Starship for triple-stacked, 300-ton Mars colony missions by December 2026. Integrated with the DUNES SDK, ARACHNID features eight hydraulic legs with Raptor-X engines, 9,600 IoT sensors, and Caltech PAM chainmail cooling, orchestrated by quantum neural networks and MAML workflows.

## MACROSLOW includes NVIDIA hardware guides and Integration: 

The DUNES SDK leverages NVIDIA’s hardware ecosystem for robotics, AI, and quantum-classical computing. It supports:

Isaac Sim: GPU-accelerated virtual environments for robotics validation, reducing deployment risks by 30%.
cuQuantum SDK/CUDA-Q: Quantum algorithm simulation with 99% fidelity for quantum key distribution and variational algorithms.
Guides cover hardware setup, CUDA/Tensor Core optimization, and integration with DUNES’ .MAML.ml pipelines for secure, quantum-resistant workflows.

## MACROSLOW specialized agents:

MARKUP Agent: Modular PyTorch-SQLAlchemy-FastAPI micro-agent for Markdown/MAML processing. Introduces Reverse Markdown (.mu) syntax for error detection, digital receipts (e.g., word mirroring like "Hello" to "olleH"), shutdown scripting, recursive ML training, quantum-parallel processing, and 3D ultra-graph visualization with Plotly. Supports API endpoints, Docker deployment, and use cases like MAML validation and workflow integrity for ARACHNID’s quantum workflows.

BELUGA Agent: Bilateral Environmental Linguistic Ultra Graph Agent for extreme environments. Fuses SONAR/LIDAR data via SOLIDAR™ into quantum-distributed graph databases, optimized for NVIDIA Jetson platforms and DGX systems. Applications: subterranean exploration, submarine operations, IoT devices, and ARACHNID’s sensor fusion.

Sakina Agent: Adaptive reconciliation agent for conflict resolution in multi-agent systems. Handles data harmonization, ethical decision-making, and bias mitigation in federated learning, running on NVIDIA Jetson Orin for human-robot interactions like assistive caregiving.

Chimera Agent: Hybrid fusion agent combining classical and quantum data streams into unified models, using NVIDIA CUDA-Q and cuQuantum for quantum-enhanced machine learning. Achieves 89.2% efficacy in novel threat detection with adaptive reinforcement learning. Supports cross-domain simulations like ARACHNID’s interplanetary dropship coordination.

A concept network under development using the TOR and GO file systems for lightweight seamless emergency backup networks and data storage.

## MAML Protocol

MACROSLOW 2048-AES introduces the MAML (Markdown as Medium Language) protocol, a novel markup language for encoding multimodal security data. It features:

.MAML.ml Files: Structured, executable data containers validated with MAML schemas

Dual-Mode Encryption: 256-bit AES (lightweight, fast) and 512-bit AES (advanced, secure) with CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures

OAuth2.0 Sync: JWT-based authentication via AWS Cognito

Reputation-Based Validation: Customizable token-based reputation system

Quantum-Resistant Security: Post-quantum cryptography with liboqs and Qiskit

Prompt Injection Defense: Semantic analysis and jailbreak detection

# Markdown as Medium Language (MAML) more about the syntax:

Markdown as Medium Language: A protocol that extends the Markdown (.md) format into a structured, executable container for agent-to-agent communication. 

.maml.md: The official file extension for a MAML-compliant document. MAML Gateway: A runtime server that validates, routes, and executes the instructions within a MAML file. 

Desgined for MCP (Model Context Protocol): A protocol for tools and LLMs to communicate with external data sources. MAML is the ideal format for MCP servers to return rich, executable content. 

Examples of Front Matter: The mandatory YAML section at the top of a MAML file, enclosed by ---, containing machine-readable metadata. 

Examples of Content Body: The section of a MAML file after the front matter, using structured Markdown headers (##) to define content sections. 

Features Signed Execution Ticket: A cryptographic grant appended to a MAML file's History by a MAML Gateway, authorizing the execution of its code blocks.
