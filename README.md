### 🐪 2048-AES MAML as the OCaml Orchestrator**

✅ MAML 2048-AES becomes the perfect vehicle for distributing and executing OCaml code itself.

*   ** ✨ 2048-AES Verifiable Workflows:** A complex, verified algorithm written in OCaml can be packaged into a MAML file. The `Context` section explains the proof, the `Code_Blocks` section contains the OCaml code, and the `Input_Schema`/`Output_Schema` define its interface.
    ````markdown
    ## Code_Blocks
    ```ocaml
    (* Formal verification of a neural network property *)
    let verify_network_property (network : nn) (property : prop) : bool =
      ... (* OCaml code for verification *)
    ```
    ````
*   ** ✨ 2048-AES Hybrid Workflows:** MAML orchestrates workflows that span multiple languages. OCaml can handle the high-assurance components, while Python pre-processes data and Qiskit runs a quantum circuit. The MAML file is the manifest that ties them all together.

## 🐪 2048-AES Overview of MAML ##

**MAML (Markdown as Medium Language)** is a new syntax and protocol designed by Webxos to evolve Markdown into a structured, extensible, and machine-friendly documentation language. While Markdown democratized formatting, MAML transforms it into a **semantic medium**—bridging human readability with intelligent data transfer. ✨

This guide introduces MAML to GitHub developers, outlining its syntax, use cases, and integration potential with modern API gateways, developer tools, and intelligent agents. ✨

**License: MAML Protocol v1.0 – Attribution Required**


Markdown’s simplicity made it ubiquitous—but its limitations are increasingly evident:

- ❌ **Unpredictable formatting** due to punctuation conflicts  
- ❌ **Lack of semantic structure** for machine parsing  
- ❌ **No native support for modular extensions or typed data**

**2048-AES MAML solves these problems** by introducing a **systematic, extensible syntax** that supports:

- ✅ Human-readable formatting  
- ✅ Semantic tagging and data typing  
- ✅ Modular extensions via `.maml.md` files  
- ✅ API-ready documentation for intelligent agents
