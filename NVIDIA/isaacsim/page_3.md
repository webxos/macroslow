# 📖 PAGE 3: TRAINING A HUMANOID ROBOT WITH GLASTONBURY 2048 & ISAAC SIM – NOVICE TO FIRST STEPS

🎉 **You’ve launched your sandbox — now let’s train a humanoid!**  
This page guides you through **GLASTONBURY 2048 Suite SDK** + **Isaac Sim** to teach a **NVIDIA GR00T-based humanoid** basic skills using **quantum-accelerated reinforcement learning** — all via **MAML workflows**, **no deep coding**, and **light, friendly steps**.

---

## 🤖 Meet Your Humanoid: GR00T in Isaac Sim

- **Name**: `gr00t_novice.usd` (pre-loaded in your Docker)
- **Capabilities**: Walk, pick objects, wave
- **Powered by**: Isaac Lab (reinforcement learning framework)
- **Enhanced by**: GLASTONBURY’s **quantum reward shaping**

> 🧠 *Think of GR00T as your digital apprentice — ready to learn from quantum-optimized feedback!*

---

## 🎯 Goal: Teach GR00T to **Walk Forward 5 Meters**

We’ll use:
- **Isaac Lab** → Physics + RL environment
- **GLASTONBURY MAML** → Quantum reward booster
- **CHIMERA Head** → Runs Qiskit circuit for reward probability

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Open the Pre-Built MAML Workflow

```bash
# Inside your container or local clone
