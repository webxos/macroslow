### NVIDIA Integration

NVIDIA’s high-performance computing (HPC) ecosystem—spanning CUDA-enabled GPUs, Jetson platforms, and the Isaac robotics suite—with the 2048-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) protocol, delivering quantum-resistant security for robotics, AI, and quantum applications. By integrating Python, SQLAlchemy, Docker, and YAML configurations, DUNES provides a modular, forkable platform that leverages NVIDIA’s hardware strengths, including Jetson Orin’s Tensor Cores for edge AI, A100/H100 GPUs for data-intensive processing, and CUDA-Q for quantum simulations. This library, comprising detailed guides and SDKs, empowers NVIDIA developers to build production-ready applications, from autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to quantum-enhanced machine learning, with performance metrics like 94.7% true positive rates in threat detection and 247ms detection latency in beta testing.

### Vision

NVIDIA’s hardware is the backbone of Quantum MCP’ capabilities. The **Jetson Orin series** (Nano, AGX Orin) delivers up to 275 TOPS for edge inference, enabling real-time robotics and IoT applications. **A100 and H100 GPUs**, with up to 3,000 TFLOPS, accelerate AI training, quantum simulations, and data analytics. The **Isaac Sim** platform, built on NVIDIA’s Omniverse, provides GPU-accelerated virtual environments for robotics validation, while the **cuQuantum SDK** and **CUDA-Q platform** enable quantum algorithm development. DUNES aligns with NVIDIA’s Project GR00T for humanoid robotics, ensuring seamless integration with cutting-edge tools. This library provides comprehensive guides to maximize these hardware capabilities, making DUNES a vital resource for NVIDIA developers.
