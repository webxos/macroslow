## üåå The Quantum Beast Awakens: QLORA as the Memory-Efficient Core of CHIMERA HEADS
In the quantum-encrypted forge of 2025, MACROSLOW 2048-AES harnesses QLORA‚Äîthe revolutionary 4-bit quantized finetuning paradigm‚Äîto empower 65B-parameter models on a single 48GB GPU, preserving 16-bit performance while slashing memory by 80%. Forged within CHIMERA 2048 SDK, QLORA backpropagates gradients through frozen NF4-quantized LLMs into Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA), enabling DUNES, GLASTONBURY, and SAKINA Agent to achieve 99.3% of ChatGPT-level performance in 24 hours on NVIDIA H100s.
Core Innovations:

(a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4): Information-theoretically optimal for Gaussian weights.
(b) Double Quantization: Quantizes constants ‚Üí ~0.37 bits/parameter.
(c) Paged Optimizers: Manages VRAM spikes via NVMe offloading.

## MACROSLOW Integration: QLORA powers MAML-orchestrated workflows across Four CHIMERA HEADS:

HEAD_1/2 (Qiskit Quantum): Hybrid LoRA for quantum-classical fusion.
HEAD_3/4 (PyTorch AI): Guanaco-class models for SAKINA ethical reconciliation.

NVIDIA Synergy: A100/H100 + Jetson Orin enable edge finetuning; cuBLAS + Tensor Cores accelerate NF4 dequantization.
Use Cases:

SAKINA Agent: Finetune 33B LLaMA on conflict resolution datasets.
GLASTONBURY Medical: 65B model for Neuralink diagnostics.
PROJECT ARACHNID: Trajectory optimization via instruction-tuned LLMs.
