# Introduction to TORGO (aka INFINITY) NETWORKS
## Role in Glastonbury 2048 SDK with TORGO

MAML (Markdown as Medium Language) is a Markdown-based protocol for defining executable workflows in the Glastonbury 2048 AES Suite SDK. Integrated with TORGO, it supports secure, federated data archiving for astrobotany and quantum linguistics, enhancing space research and sustainable technologies.

### Objectives
- **Workflow Automation**: Define tasks with YAML front matter and structured sections.
- **Interoperability**: Standardize workflows for global collaboration.
- **Quantum Readiness**: Support Qiskit and CUDA for advanced processing.
- **Security**: Leverage TORGOâ€™s 2048-bit AES encryption for data protection.

### Role in SDK
MAML orchestrates workflows for astrobotany experiments and quantum linguistic analysis, while TORGO archives results securely. Together, they enable researchers to process NASA/SpaceX data and deploy on MCP servers.

### Why MAML with TORGO?
This combination unifies workflow execution and data archiving, ensuring reliability, security, and scalability for space missions.
