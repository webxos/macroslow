# üê™ PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES: TypeScript Guide for Quantum-Secure Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

*TypeScript-Powered Quantum MCP Server with DUNES Minimalist SDK for Legacy and Quantum Integration*

## PAGE 2: Setting Up the TypeScript MCP Server with DUNES Minimalist SDK

Building on the foundational concepts introduced in Page 1, this second page of the **PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES TypeScript Guide** dives into the practical setup of a quantum-secure **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server using the **DUNES Minimalist SDK**. This page focuses on configuring the development environment, installing dependencies, structuring the TypeScript project, and initializing the core components of the MCP server. By leveraging **TypeScript**‚Äôs type safety and modularity, developers can create a robust server that integrates with legacy systems, processes **MAML (Markdown as Medium Language)** workflows, and harnesses quantum-resistant security with 2048-bit AES encryption. This guide provides step-by-step instructions, code examples, and best practices to ensure a seamless setup, preparing you for advanced implementation in subsequent pages. With the camel emoji (üê™) guiding us through the computational frontier, let‚Äôs establish the groundwork for a future-ready MCP server.

### Prerequisites for the TypeScript MCP Server

Before setting up the MCP server, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher, providing a robust runtime for TypeScript and server-side JavaScript.
- **TypeScript**: Version 5.0 or higher, installed globally or as a project dependency for type-safe development.
- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher, required for Qiskit, PyTorch, and SQLAlchemy integration with TypeScript via a Python bridge.
- **Docker**: Version 24.0 or higher, for containerized deployment of the MCP server.
- **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit**: Version 12.0 or higher, to leverage CUDA-enabled GPUs (e.g., A100, H100, or Jetson Orin) for quantum simulations and AI workloads.
- **Git**: For cloning the DUNES repository and managing version control.
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL for lightweight testing, with SQLAlchemy or TypeORM for database management.
- **Kubernetes/Helm**: Optional, for scalable deployment in production environments.
- **Dependencies**: Libraries like `fastify`, `axios`, `typeorm`, `jsonwebtoken`, and a hypothetical `qiskit.js` for quantum integration.

These prerequisites ensure compatibility with the DUNES Minimalist SDK‚Äôs quantum and classical components, enabling seamless integration with NVIDIA‚Äôs hardware ecosystem.

### Installing Dependencies and Cloning the Repository

To begin, clone the PROJECT DUNES repository and install the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webxos/dunes-2048-aes.git
   cd dunes-2048-aes
