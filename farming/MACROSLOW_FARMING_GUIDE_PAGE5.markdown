This page outlines the quantum neural network (QNN) training pipeline for the MACROSLOW SDK, designed to power autonomous farming robots inspired by Greenfield Robotics' BOTONY‚Ñ¢ system and compatible with platforms like Blue River Technology, FarmWise, and Carbon Robotics. The pipeline leverages NVIDIA hardware (A100/H100 GPUs, Jetson Orin), Qiskit for quantum circuits, PyTorch for classical AI, and the Chimera Head‚Äôs Model Context Protocol (MCP) to train QNNs for real-time tasks like weed detection, path optimization, and soil analysis. Integrated with MAML (.maml.md) workflows and MU (.mu) receipts, the pipeline achieves 94.7% mean average precision (mAP) in weed detection, <0.07% path overlap, and 247ms inference latency, all secured with 2048-AES encryption. This page details the multi-stage training process, agentic learning loops, and performance metrics for scalable, quantum-enhanced farming.

### QNN Training Pipeline Overview
The QNN training pipeline combines classical deep learning (PyTorch) with quantum algorithms (Qiskit/cuQuantum) to produce hybrid models that process multidimensional data (context, intent, environment, history) in a quadralinear framework. Hosted on NVIDIA A100/H100 GPUs, the pipeline uses a multi-stage Dockerfile to ingest data, pre-train quantum circuits, and fine-tune hybrid models, with BELUGA, MARKUP, and Sakina Agents facilitating sensor fusion, recursive training, and conflict resolution. The pipeline supports tasks like weed classification (e.g., amaranth, foxtail), path planning, and soil analytics for row-crop fields (soybeans, sorghum, cotton).

### Multi-Stage Training Pipeline
The pipeline is defined in a YAML configuration for Dockerized execution, ensuring reproducibility and scalability across NVIDIA hardware.

```yaml
# train_qnn.yaml
stages:
  - name: data_ingest
    image: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.06-py3
    resources: { cpu: 16, memory: 64GB }
    script: python ingest_soybean_dataset.py
  - name: quantum_pretrain
    image: nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda-quantum:latest
    resources: { nvidia.com/gpu: 2, memory: 128GB }
    script: python vqe_pretrain.py --qubits 8 --shots 1000
  - name: hybrid_finetune
    image: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.06-py3
    resources: { nvidia.com/gpu: 4, memory: 256GB }
    script: torchrun --nnodes=4 finetune_qnn.py --epochs 50
```

**Stage 1: Data Ingestion**
- **Input**: RGB images (12 MP, 450‚Äì950 nm), LiDAR point clouds, soil probe data (moisture, NPK, pH), and historical yield rasters.
- **Process**: BELUGA Agent fuses data into a quantum graph database using SOLIDAR‚Ñ¢ engine, stored in SQLAlchemy (sqlite:///farm_data.db).
- **Output**: Preprocessed dataset (e.g., /data/soybean_400acre.torch) for training.
- **Hardware**: A100 GPU, 16 CPU cores, 64GB RAM.
- **Duration**: ~2 hours for 400-acre dataset.

**Stage 2: Quantum Pre-Training**
- **Algorithm**: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for path optimization and feature encoding.
- **Process**: Qiskit circuits (8 qubits) encode environmental features (e.g., row spacing, weed density) using superposition and entanglement, optimized with SPSA.
- **Output**: Pre-trained quantum parameters (/models/vqe_params.pt).
- **Hardware**: 2√ó A100 GPUs, cuQuantum SDK, 128GB RAM.
- **Duration**: ~12 hours for 1,000 shots per circuit.

**Stage 3: Hybrid Fine-Tuning**
- **Model**: Hybrid QNN combining PyTorch CNN (weed classification) and Qiskit circuits (path planning).
- **Process**: Fine-tune using torchrun across 4 nodes, integrating quantum features with classical gradients.
- **Output**: Final QNN model (/models/hybrid_qnn.pt).
- **Hardware**: 4√ó H100 GPUs, 256GB RAM, 3,000 TFLOPS.
- **Duration**: ~58 hours for 50 epochs.

### Agentic Learning Loop
The training pipeline incorporates MACROSLOW agents for adaptive learning:
- **BELUGA Agent**: Fuses sensor data (LiDAR, RGB, soil) into quantum graph databases, enabling context-aware feature extraction.
- **MARKUP Agent**: Generates .mu receipts from .maml.md workflows, supporting recursive training by mirroring data (e.g., ‚Äúweed‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúdeew‚Äù) for error detection.
- **Sakina Agent**: Resolves data conflicts in federated learning, ensuring ethical model updates across distributed farms.
