This page outlines the swarm logic for coordinating hundreds of IoT-enabled agricultural robots within the MACROSLOW SDK, inspired by Greenfield Robotics' BOTONY‚Ñ¢ system and compatible with platforms like Blue River Technology, FarmWise, and Carbon Robotics. Leveraging the Chimera Head‚Äôs quantum-enhanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, this logic enables real-time synchronization of robot fleets for precision farming tasks such as weeding, planting, and soil analysis across row-crop fields (e.g., soybeans, sorghum, cotton). The swarm logic integrates NVIDIA hardware (Jetson Orin Nano/AGX, A100/H100 GPUs), MAML (.maml.md) workflows, and MU (.mu) receipts to achieve <1% crop damage, 247ms decision latency, and 2048-AES quantum-resistant security. This page details leader election, task broadcasting, local execution, consensus mechanisms, and scalability, ensuring efficient and secure operation of robotic swarms.

### Swarm Logic Architecture
The swarm logic operates as a decentralized, quantum-distributed system orchestrated by the Chimera Head‚Äôs four-core architecture. Each core (HEAD_1 to HEAD_4) handles specific tasks, with two cores running Qiskit for quantum computations and two running PyTorch for AI inference, all secured by 2048-AES encryption and CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures. The logic is designed to minimize path overlaps (<0.07%), optimize energy usage, and ensure fault tolerance through quadra-segment regeneration.

**Chimera Head Assignment**
| Head | Function | Latency | Hardware |
|------|----------|---------|----------|
| HEAD_1 | Quantum path optimization (VQE) | 148ms | Jetson AGX Orin (275 TOPS) |
| HEAD_2 | Quantum collision avoidance | 132ms | Jetson AGX Orin (275 TOPS) |
| HEAD_3 | PyTorch weed classification | 28ms | Jetson Orin Nano (40 TOPS) |
| HEAD_4 | PyTorch soil analytics | 35ms | Jetson Orin Nano (40 TOPS) |

### Swarm Protocol Steps
1. **Leader Election**:
   - A Jetson AGX Orin-equipped robot is elected as the swarm leader using a reputation-based token system stored in custom .md wallets.
   - Tokens are earned via successful task completion, validated by MU receipts, ensuring trust in decentralized networks.
   - Election algorithm: Weighted random selection based on reputation score, computed in <50ms using PyTorch on HEAD_3.

2. **Task Broadcast**:
   - The swarm leader distributes .maml.md workflows via MQTT over 2048-AES-encrypted channels, ensuring secure task assignment.
   - Example task: ‚ÄúWeed 400 acres of soybeans, targeting amaranth and foxtail, 22:00‚Äì04:00.‚Äù
   - Broadcast latency: <100ms for 128 robots, routed through the Chimera Head‚Äôs FastAPI gateway.

3. **Local Execution**:
   - Each robot (Jetson Orin Nano) executes a Qiskit sub-circuit for path planning and a PyTorch model for weed detection.
   - Qiskit VQE optimizes paths using quantum superposition, reducing overlap to <0.07%.
   - PyTorch inference processes RGB/LiDAR data for real-time weed classification (<30ms per frame).

4. **Consensus Mechanism**:
   - Robots submit MU (.mu) receipts to the swarm leader, generated by the MARKUP Agent, to confirm task completion without overlaps.
   - BELUGA Agent fuses sensor data into a quantum graph database, validated by Ortac runtime for correctness.
   - Consensus achieved in <200ms for 128 robots, with Sakina Agent resolving conflicts via federated learning.

5. **Regeneration and Fault Tolerance**:
   - If a Chimera Head fails (e.g., HEAD_1), quadra-segment regeneration rebuilds it in <5s using CUDA-accelerated data redistribution from remaining heads.
   - Prometheus monitors CUDA utilization (>85%) and swarm health, logging to SQLAlchemy for auditability.

### Scalability Framework
The swarm logic scales seamlessly from small to large fleets:
- **128 Robots**: Managed by a single Chimera instance (Jetson AGX Orin), with <100ms task coordination.
- **1,024 Robots**: Handled by 8 Chimera instances via Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling, maintaining <150ms latency.
- **10,000 Robots (Future)**: Planned for Q3 2026, using a single Chimera cluster with federated QNNs.

**Scaling Example (400-acre Soybean Mission)**:
- 128 robots, 2 Chimera instances, 11-hour night operation.
- Outcome: 0.58% crop damage, 2.4√ó yield increase vs. manual methods.
- Resource usage: 2 kWh per robot, 85% CUDA utilization.
