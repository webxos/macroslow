PAGE 4: BELUGA AGENT – SOLIDAR FUSION ENGINE, QUANTUM GRAPH DATABASE, AND EDGE-NATIVE IOT FRAMEWORK  

This page delivers a complete, exhaustive, text-only technical deep dive into the **BELUGA Agent**, the bilateral environmental linguistic ultra graph agent responsible for real-time sensor fusion, quantum-distributed data modeling, and edge-native IoT orchestration within the CHIMERA 2048-AES ecosystem. Every component — from raw sensor ingestion to quantum graph construction, adaptive anomaly detection, and zero-trust edge deployment — is documented with full operational logic, data structures, performance metrics, and integration pathways with DJI Agras T50/T100 drones. All processes are designed for sub-100ms latency in disconnected environments, 2048-bit AES-equivalent security, and verifiable integrity via MAML and .mu receipts.  

BELUGA AGENT OVERVIEW – BILATERAL ENVIRONMENTAL FUSION  

BELUGA is a hybrid classical-quantum sensor fusion system inspired by cetacean echolocation and submarine SONAR-LIDAR integration. It fuses **bilateral data streams** — **SONAR-equivalent radar** (DJI phased array) and **LIDAR-equivalent vision** (binocular stereo) — into a unified **SOLIDAR™ (Sensor-Originated Linguistic Integrated Data and Reasoning)** representation. This is augmented with **9600+ ground IoT nodes** (soil moisture, pH, NPK, temperature) to create a **quantum-distributed graph database** that enables predictive, adaptive, and verifiable precision agriculture.  

BELUGA operates on **NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin** at the edge (per drone or base station) and synchronizes with **H100 cloud clusters** for long-term modeling. All data is encrypted in flight and at rest using **512-bit AES per CHIMERA HEAD**, with **CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures** on every graph update.  

SOLIDAR FUSION ENGINE – FULL DATA FLOW AND PROCESSING PIPELINE  

Step 1: Raw Sensor Ingestion (Edge, 5 Hz Loop)  
- **Input Stream A – Radar (SONAR Analog)**:  
  - Source: DJI RD241608RF/RB phased array radar  
  - Data Rate: 1.2 million points per second  
  - Format: Polar coordinates (range, azimuth, elevation, intensity)  
  - Resolution: 5 cm vertical, 10 cm horizontal  
  - Preprocessing: Noise filtering via Gaussian kernel (σ = 0.3), intensity thresholding > 12 dB  
- **Input Stream B – Vision (LIDAR Analog)**:  
  - Source: Binocular CMOS sensors (1920×1080 @ 60 fps)  
  - Data Rate: 124 MP/s raw  
  - Preprocessing: Stereo rectification, disparity map via Semi-Global Block Matching (SGBM), depth accuracy 2 cm at 5 m  
- **Input Stream C – Ground IoT**:  
  - Source: 9600 LoRaWAN nodes (1 per 100 m²)  
  - Update Rate: 10 seconds  
  - Payload: soil_moisture (0–100%), pH (3.0–9.0), N (0–500 ppm), P (0–200 ppm), K (0–400 ppm), temp (-10 to 50°C)  

Step 2: Bilateral Synchronization and Voxelization  
BELUGA aligns radar and vision streams using **timestamp synchronization** via PTP (IEEE 1588) with sub-microsecond accuracy. Both streams are projected into a **3D voxel grid**:  
- Voxel Size: 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm  
- Grid Extent: 150 m × 150 m × 50 m (centered on drone)  
- Occupancy Model: Probabilistic — each voxel stores log-odds of occupancy: log(p/(1-p))  
- Fusion Rule: Bayesian update — radar and vision contribute weighted evidence (radar weight 0.6, vision 0.4 due to lighting robustness)  

Step 3: SOLIDAR Linguistic Tagging  
Each occupied voxel is tagged with **semantic labels** via PyTorch CNN (HEAD-3):  
- Labels: crop_canopy, weed, bare_soil, pest_damage, water_pool, obstacle, drone_shadow  
- Confidence Threshold: 0.78  
- Output: Labeled occupancy grid with per-voxel probability vector  

Step 4: IoT Ground Truth Integration  
Ground sensor data is interpolated using **Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)** with power parameter 2.0:  
- For each voxel at ground level (z < 0.3 m), assign weighted average of nearest 8 IoT nodes  
- Create **ground truth layer**: moisture_map, nutrient_deficiency_map, stress_index  

Step 5: Quantum Graph Construction (QDB)  
The fused SOLIDAR grid is converted into a **quantum-distributed property graph**:  
- **Nodes**:  
  - Type: voxel, iot_sensor, drone, waypoint  
  - Properties: position (x,y,z), occupancy_prob, label, moisture, pH, pest_score, timestamp  
- **Edges**:  
  - Type: adjacent (8-connectivity in 3D), influences (IoT → voxel), observed_by (drone → voxel)  
  - Properties: distance, wind_flow_vector, drift_risk  
- Storage: **Neo4j with NVIDIA cuGraph acceleration**  
- Quantum Enhancement: Graph state is encoded into **Qiskit quantum circuit** for variational optimization (e.g., minimum drift path)  

Step 6: Anomaly Detection and Adaptive Response  
BELUGA runs **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** on QDB every 200 ms:  
- Model: GraphSAGE with 3 layers, 256 hidden units  
- Task: Node classification — predict pest_outbreak_risk (0–1)  
- Threshold: 0.65 → trigger localized spray increase  
- Output: Updated spray_volume_map (L/ha per 10 cm voxel)  

QUANTUM GRAPH DATABASE (QDB) – STRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS  

QDB is a **hybrid classical-quantum graph store** running on Jetson Orin with cloud sync:  
- **Classical Layer**: Neo4j with APOC plugins for geospatial queries  
- **Quantum Layer**: Qiskit circuits embedded as node properties  
- **Key Operations**:  
  - INSERT: New voxel → encrypted node with 512-bit AES  
  - UPDATE: IoT reading → Cypher query with Ortac-verified OCaml trigger  
  - QUERY: "Find all voxels with moisture < 30% and pest_score > 0.7" → returns geojson  
  - OPTIMIZE: Qiskit VQE on subgraph to minimize total chemical drift  

Example Cypher Query (executed in MAML Code Block):  
MATCH (v:voxel {moisture < 30})-[r:influences]->(s:iot_sensor)  
WHERE v.pest_score > 0.7  
RETURN v.position, v.required_spray_rate  
ORDER BY v.drift_risk DESC
