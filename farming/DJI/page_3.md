PAGE 3: MAML WORKFLOW EXECUTION, OCAML FORMAL VERIFICATION, AND REAL-TIME AGENT ORCHESTRATION IN PRECISION AGRICULTURE  

This page provides a complete, exhaustive, text-only explanation of how the CHIMERA 2048-AES SDK executes MAML (Markdown as Medium Language) workflows within the DJI Agras T50 and T100 agentic IoT farming rig. Every stage of workflow ingestion, parsing, verification, execution, logging, and rollback is documented in granular detail. The integration of OCaml with Ortac for formal verification, PyTorch for adaptive decisioning, Qiskit for quantum-optimized path planning, and SQLAlchemy for immutable audit trails is fully deconstructed. All processes are designed for zero-trust, post-quantum security, and verifiable automation at scale across 21.3+ hectares per hour.  

MAML WORKFLOW STRUCTURE – FULL SCHEMA DEFINITION  

A MAML file (.maml.md) is a self-contained, executable data container that encodes context, code, inputs, outputs, and cryptographic proofs in structured Markdown. CHIMERA 2048 treats every MAML file as a mission-critical artifact requiring 2048-bit AES-equivalent encryption and formal verification before execution.  

Standard MAML Schema (raw text representation):  

Context Section  
This section contains natural language mission description, environmental parameters, and agent roles. Example:  
Context: Orchard Block 14, 52 acres, 14 percent slope, wind 4.2 meters per second from northwest, temperature 28 degrees Celsius, crop type: almond, pest pressure: high navel orangeworm. BELUGA Agent to fuse soil moisture and radar data. MARKUP Agent to generate .mu receipt upon completion.  

Code Blocks Section  
Contains executable code in multiple languages, each fenced and labeled. Supported languages: Python, OCaml, Qiskit, SQL, Bash. Example:  
Python Block –  
import numpy as np;  
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit;  
qc = QuantumCircuit(8);  
# Variational quantum eigensolver for wind-induced droplet drift  
# Input: wind vector, droplet size distribution  
# Output: drift offset matrix  

OCaml Block –  
let safe_altitude terrain slope =  
  if slope > 14.0 then terrain +. 1.5 else terrain +. 0.8;;  
(* Ortac-verified: ensures minimum 0.8m clearance over canopy *)  

Qiskit Block –  
from qiskit.circuit.library import RealAmplitudes;  
ansatz = RealAmplitudes(8, reps=3);  
# Parameterized circuit for terrain-following optimization  

Input Schema Section  
Defines structured input data in JSON Schema format. Example:  
{  
  "field_boundary": { "type": "geojson", "required": true },  
  "wind_vector": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "number" } },  
  "soil_moisture": { "type": "array", "minItems": 9600 },  
  "crop_height_raster": { "type": "string", "format": "tiff_base64" }  
}  

Output Schema Section  
Defines expected outputs and cryptographic proof requirements. Example:  
{  
  "flight_path": { "type": "string", "format": "gpx" },  
  "spray_volume_map": { "type": "geojson" },  
  "mu_receipt": { "type": "string", "format": "reverse_markdown" },  
  "dilithium_signature": { "type": "string", "length": 2420 }  
}  

Permissions Section  
Defines agent access control using OAuth2.0 JWT claims. Example:  
Permissions:  
- BELUGA: read:sensors, write:graph_db  
- MARKUP: write:receipts, read:logs  
- CHIMERA HEAD-1: execute:qiskit  
- CHIMERA HEAD-3: execute:pytorch  

CHIMERA 2048 MAML EXECUTION PIPELINE – STEP-BY-STEP  

Step 1: MAML Ingestion and Encryption  
The DJI SmartFarm app or ground station uploads the .maml.md file to the MCP server via HTTPS with client certificate. CHIMERA HEAD-2 (Qiskit) generates a 512-bit AES key using quantum random number generation (QRNG) simulated via Qiskit Aer. The file is encrypted in memory and never written to disk unencrypted.  

Step 2: Schema Validation  
CHIMERA HEAD-4 (PyTorch RL) runs a lightweight JSON Schema validator written in OCaml. Any deviation from Input/Output Schema triggers immediate rejection and .mu error receipt generation. Validation time: less than 50 ms.  

Step 3: OCaml Formal Verification with Ortac  
All OCaml code blocks are compiled with Ortac, a formal verification tool that proves absence of runtime errors, memory safety, and functional correctness. Example proof goal:  
safe_altitude never returns negative clearance  
Ortac generates a machine-checked proof certificate embedded in the MAML file. If proof fails, workflow is aborted and logged with reason: formal_verification_failed.  

Step 4: Quantum Path Optimization (HEAD-1)  
Qiskit circuit from Code Blocks is executed on NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) minimizes a cost function representing total droplet drift under wind and terrain constraints. Input: wind vector, droplet size, field boundary. Output: 3D offset field. Execution time: 147 ms on H100 GPU.  

Step 5: PyTorch Adaptive Decisioning (HEAD-3)  
PyTorch model (ResNet-50 backbone) processes BELUGA-fused sensor data to generate pest hotspot probability map. Output is thresholded at 0.72 confidence. Zones above threshold receive 1.5× base spray rate. Model is retrained nightly using federated learning across 48 farms. Inference time: 83 ms on Jetson AGX Orin.  

Step 6: Flight Path Synthesis  
OCaml-verified safe_altitude function is applied to terrain raster. Qiskit drift offsets are added. Result is converted to GPX format with 1-meter waypoint density. Path is encrypted with 512-bit AES and signed with CRYSTALS-Dilithium.  

Step 7: Execution on DJI Agras Flight Controller  
Encrypted GPX is transmitted via O3 Agras link. Drone decrypts using session key derived from HEAD-2 QRNG. Flight controller executes path with real-time deviation correction less than 15 cm.  

Step 8: MARKUP Agent .mu Reverse Receipt Generation  
Upon mission completion, full forward log is generated:  
# Spray Log: Block 14, 21.3ha, 312.4L applied  
MARKUP Agent reverses structure and content:  
goL yarps :41 kcolB ,a3.12 ,L4.213 deilppa  
Reverse file is saved as block14_spray.mu. Double reversal (forward → reverse → forward) verifies integrity. File is hashed with BLAKE3 and signed.  

Step 9: SQLAlchemy Immutable Audit Logging  
All artifacts are inserted into SQLAlchemy-managed PostgreSQL database:  
- maml_file (encrypted blob)  
- execution_proof (Ortac certificate)  
- mu_receipt (reverse markdown)  
- dilithium_signature (2420 bytes)  
- timestamp, drone_id, operator_id  
Database uses append-only tables with row-level encryption.  

Step 10: Rollback and Self-Healing  
If any step fails, CHIMERA initiates rollback:  
- Undo spray commands via reverse .mu script  
- Regenerate compromised HEAD via CUDA-Q in less than 5 seconds  
- Notify operator via encrypted push  

REAL-TIME AGENT ORCHESTRATION – BELUGA, MARKUP, AND CHIMERA HEADS  

BELUGA Agent – Sensor Fusion Loop  
Runs at 5 Hz on Jetson Orin. Inputs:  
- 24 GHz radar point cloud (1.2 million points/sec)  
- Binocular stereo frames (60 fps)  
- 9600 IoT soil sensors (updated every 10 seconds)  
Outputs:  
- SOLIDAR 3D occupancy grid (voxel size 10 cm)  
- Quantum graph in Neo4j with time-series edges  
- Anomaly score per voxel (pest, leak, obstacle)  

MARKUP Agent – Integrity and Audit  
Runs post-mission. Generates .mu files for:  
- Flight logs  
- Spray volume maps  
- Sensor calibration records  
- Battery health reports  
Each .mu file enables tamper detection: any edit breaks reverse-forward symmetry.  

CHIMERA HEAD Coordination  
- HEAD-1 and HEAD-2 run in cloud (H100) for heavy simulation  
- HEAD-3 and HEAD-4 run on edge (Jetson) for low-latency control  
- All heads synchronize state via 2048-AES encrypted gRPC every 500 ms  
- If edge loses cloud link, local heads continue with degraded (non-quantum) policy
