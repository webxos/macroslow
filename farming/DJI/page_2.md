PAGE 2: IN-DEPTH HARDWARE DECONSTRUCTION AND CHIMERA 2048-AES INTEGRATION FOR DJI AGRAS T50/T100  

This page delivers a complete, granular, text-only dissection of every hardware subsystem in the DJI Agras T50 and T100 agricultural drones. Each component is explained in full technical detail, including physical specifications, operational principles, failure modes, and precise integration points with the CHIMERA 2048-AES SDK. All data is structured for direct parsing into MAML schemas, SQLAlchemy models, or PyTorch training pipelines. No images, no links, no scripts — only raw, exhaustive English documentation.  

DJI AGRAS T50 – FULL HARDWARE BREAKDOWN  

1. AIRCRAFT FRAME AND STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY  
   The T50 airframe is constructed from aerospace-grade carbon fiber composite with aluminum alloy joint reinforcements. The unfolded dimensions measure 2800 mm length by 3085 mm width by 735 mm height, providing a diagonal wheelbase of 2200 mm for optimal stability during high-payload operations. When arms are unfolded but propellers folded, dimensions reduce to 1590 mm × 1900 mm × 735 mm, enabling compact ground transport. Fully folded state is 1115 mm × 750 mm × 735 mm for storage in standard shipping containers.  
   Empty weight including the 30,000 mAh battery is 39.9 kg. Maximum takeoff weight reaches 92 kg in spraying configuration and 101 kg in spreading mode. The frame supports a maximum pitch angle of 30 degrees, allowing operations on sloped terrain up to 14 percent grade without stability loss.  
   CHIMERA Integration: The frame’s inertial measurement unit (IMU) streams 9-axis gyro/accelerometer data at 400 Hz via CAN bus to Jetson AGX Orin edge node running BELUGA Agent. This data is fused with phased array radar to generate real-time terrain-following altitude corrections, encrypted via 512-bit AES per CHIMERA HEAD and logged in SQLAlchemy with Ortac-verified OCaml motion validation.  

2. PROPULSION SYSTEM – MOTORS, ESC, AND PROPELLERS  
   Each of the eight rotors is driven by a brushless DC motor with stator size 100 mm × 18 mm and KV rating of 48 rpm per volt. Maximum pull per rotor is 28.5 kg, delivering total thrust of 228 kg at full power. Individual rotor power consumption peaks at 4500 W. Electronic speed controllers (ESCs) operate at 800 Hz PWM with active phase current sensing for torque ripple minimization.  
   Propellers are 54-inch diameter with 8.5-inch pitch, manufactured from nylon carbon fiber filament for high tensile strength and low acoustic signature. Eight propellers (four clockwise, four counterclockwise) ensure torque balance.  
   CHIMERA Integration: ESC telemetry (current, voltage, temperature, RPM) is ingested by HEAD-3 (PyTorch) for predictive failure modeling. If rotor temperature exceeds 85 degrees Celsius, CHIMERA HEAD-4 (RL) triggers automatic descent and regeneration of flight path using remaining seven rotors. All propulsion logs are mirrored into .mu reverse-receipts by MARKUP Agent for forensic audit.  

3. DUAL ATOMIZING SPRAYING SYSTEM  
   The liquid tank holds 40 liters at rated capacity. Two high-pressure peristaltic pumps (expandable to four) feed dual centrifugal atomizing disks rotating at 18,000 RPM. Nozzle model LX8060SZ supports droplet sizes from 50 to 500 micrometers, adjustable via solenoid valve duty cycle. Standard configuration delivers 16 L/min total flow; four-nozzle kit increases to 24 L/min. Spray width ranges from 4 to 11 meters at 3-meter operating height.  
   Droplet size is controlled by disk speed and pump pressure: 50–150 μm for fungicides (drift minimization), 300–500 μm for herbicides (canopy penetration).  
   CHIMERA Integration: Droplet size selection is computed by HEAD-1 (Qiskit VQE) simulating wind advection and evaporation. Real-time wind vector from onboard anemometer is input to quantum circuit; optimal disk RPM and pressure are output and enforced via OCaml-verified control loop. Spray volume per zone is logged in .maml.md with CRYSTALS-Dilithium signature.  

4. PHASED ARRAY RADAR SYSTEM (FRONT AND REAR)  
   Model RD241608RF (front) and RD241608RB (rear) operate at 24 GHz with 16 transmit and 8 receive elements per array. Effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) is capped at 20 dBm for regulatory compliance. Terrain-following range is 1 to 50 meters with 5 cm vertical resolution. Obstacle avoidance extends to 50 meters in all directions.  
   Beam steering is electronic with ±45-degree vertical and 360-degree horizontal coverage via time-division multiplexing.  
   CHIMERA Integration: Raw radar point clouds are streamed to BELUGA Agent on Jetson Orin. SOLIDAR fusion engine combines radar with binocular vision to create 3D occupancy grid updated every 200 ms. Grid is stored in quantum graph database (QDB) and used by HEAD-2 for post-quantum encrypted collision-free path planning.  

5. BINOCULAR VISION SYSTEM  
   Dual 1/1.8-inch CMOS sensors provide 1920×1080 resolution at 60 fps. Horizontal field of view is 90 degrees per camera, yielding 110-degree effective overlap for stereo depth mapping. Measurement range is 0.5 to 30 meters with 2 cm depth accuracy at 5 meters.  
   Vision-based obstacle avoidance operates in six directions: front, rear, left, right, up, down.  
   CHIMERA Integration: Stereo disparity maps are processed by PyTorch convolutional neural network (HEAD-3) for semantic segmentation (crop vs weed vs obstacle). Segmentation mask is fused with radar grid in BELUGA to generate adaptive spray exclusion zones. All vision frames are hashed and stored in .mu reverse-receipts.  

6. FPV AND AUXILIARY LIGHTING  
   Front-facing FPV camera delivers 1920×1080 at 30 fps with 120-degree FOV. Dual 1000-lumen LED arrays provide illumination for night operations up to 50 meters.  
   CHIMERA Integration: FPV stream is encrypted via 2048-AES and routed through CHIMERA gateway for remote monitoring. Light intensity is modulated by PyTorch model based on ambient lux sensor to minimize power draw.  

7. INTELLIGENT FLIGHT BATTERY AND CHARGING  
   DB1560 battery pack contains 14S high-voltage lithium polymer cells with nominal voltage 52.2 V and capacity 30,000 mAh (1566 Wh). Weight is 13.5 kg. C10000 charger delivers 7200 W, achieving 9–12 minute full charge.  
   Flight time is 7 minutes at 92 kg takeoff weight (spraying) and 18 minutes hovering empty.  
   CHIMERA Integration: Battery management system (BMS) data (cell voltages, temperature, cycle count) is monitored by HEAD-4 RL agent. Predictive maintenance model triggers preemptive landing if state of health drops below 80 percent. Charging schedules are optimized via MAML workflow to align with solar peak hours.  

8. O3 AGRAS TRANSMISSION SYSTEM  
   Operates in 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz bands with maximum 2 km range (FCC). Video latency is under 200 ms. Optional DJI Relay extends range to 5 km.  
   CHIMERA Integration: All telemetry is wrapped in 512-bit AES packets per CHIMERA HEAD. Key rotation occurs every 60 seconds via Qiskit BB84 simulation on HEAD-2.

3. RADAR AND VISION  
   Long-range millimeter-wave radar (LAR) plus phased array. 360-degree coverage.  
   CHIMERA Integration: LAR data enables 100-meter lookahead for high-speed operations.  

4. BATTERY  
   60,000 mAh with 9-minute ultra-fast charge.  
   CHIMERA Integration: Dual-battery hot-swap supported via MAML orchestration.
