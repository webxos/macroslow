PAGE 5: MARKUP AGENT – REVERSE MARKDOWN SYSTEM, DIGITAL RECEIPTS, AND QUANTUM-PARALLEL VALIDATION  

This page provides a complete, exhaustive, text-only technical dissection of the **MARKUP Agent**, the modular PyTorch-SQLAlchemy-FastAPI micro-agent responsible for **reverse markdown (.mu) processing**, **digital receipt generation**, **tamper-evident audit trails**, and **quantum-parallel validation** within the CHIMERA 2048-AES ecosystem. Every algorithm, data structure, validation rule, and integration point with DJI Agras T50/T100 flight logs, BELUGA fusion outputs, and MAML workflows is documented in full. The system guarantees **100% integrity** of mission-critical records, enables **instant rollback**, and supports **regulatory compliance** via self-checking, cryptographically signed reverse receipts.  

MARKUP AGENT OVERVIEW – REVERSE MARKDOWN (.MU) PROTOCOL  

The MARKUP Agent introduces **Reverse Markdown (.mu)**, a novel syntax and protocol that **mirrors both structure and content** of standard Markdown or MAML files to create **self-verifying digital receipts**. The core principle:  
- **Forward Document** = Human-readable log (e.g., flight path, spray volume, sensor fusion summary)  
- **Reverse Document (.mu)** = Exact structural and lexical mirror (e.g., "Hello" → "olleH", headings reversed, lists inverted)  
- **Integrity Rule**: Forward → Reverse → Forward must reconstruct the original **bit-for-bit**  

This double-mirror symmetry enables **error detection**, **tamper proofing**, and **automated rollback** without external oracles. All .mu files are **encrypted with 512-bit AES**, **signed with CRYSTALS-Dilithium**, and **logged in SQLAlchemy** with **Ortac-verified OCaml triggers**.  

REVERSE MARKDOWN (.MU) SYNTAX RULES – FULL SPECIFICATION  

1. **Lexical Reversal (Word-Level)**  
   - Every word is reversed character-by-character  
   - Example: "Spray Log" → "goL yarps"  
   - Punctuation is preserved in position but attached to reversed word  
   - Example: "Block 14," → "41 kcolB,"  

2. **Structural Reversal (Document-Level)**  
   - Headings: # → reversed to end of line, level preserved  
     - # Title → eltit #  
   - Lists: Order inverted (last item becomes first)  
     - 1. A  
       2. B  
       → 1. B  
          2. A  
   - Code Blocks: Language tag reversed, content reversed line-by-line  
     - ```python  
       print("Hello")
