# 🐪 CHIMERA 2048 API Gateway: Advanced Workflow Guide

This guide provides advanced instructions for creating and executing workflows with the **CHIMERA 2048 API Gateway** using **MAML (Markdown as Medium Language)**, enhanced with OCaml Dune 3.20.0, CPython, and Markdown.

## 🧠 Overview

MAML now supports advanced features like Dune 3.20.0 test aliases, timeouts, and BLAKE3 hashing, enabling complex quantum-classical workflows with self-correction and DSPy integration.

## 📋 Creating an Advanced Workflow

### 1. Define MAML Structure
- **Header**: Include metadata with Dune 3.20.0 % forms and advanced requirements.
- **Content**: Use OCaml, CPython, or Markdown with multi-step logic.
- **Example**:
  ```markdown

  maml_version: 2.0.0
  id: advanced-hybrid-workflow
  type: hybrid_workflow
  origin: your_organization  # --- CUSTOMIZATION POINT: Replace with your organization name ---
  requires:
    resources: cuda
    os: %{os}  # Dune 3.20.0 % form
    dspy: "enabled"  # --- CUSTOMIZATION POINT: Add custom requirements ---
  permissions:
    execute: admin
  verification:
    schema: maml-workflow-v1
  ---
  # Advanced Hybrid Workflow
  - Run with timeout: (timeout 5.0)
  ```ocaml
  let x = 42 in print_endline (string_of_int x)  (* Dune 3.20.0 alias support; customize your OCaml code *)
  ```
  ```python
  import torch; print(torch.randn(5))  (* Customize your CPython logic *)
  ```

### 2. Customize Workflow
- **File: chimera_dspy_orchestration.py**
  - Use DSPy for multi-step reasoning.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    def orchestrate_task(self, task: Dict) -> Dict:
        prompt = f"Execute task: {task}"  # --- CUSTOMIZATION POINT: Add your prompt engineering ---
        prediction = self.model(prompt)
        return {"result": prediction}
    ```

### 3. Execute Workflow
- Send via API with Dune 3.20.0 watch mode:
  ```bash
  dune build @runtest-advanced-hybrid --watch & curl -X POST http://your-cluster-ip:8000/maml/execute -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @advanced.maml.md
  ```

## 🔧 Customization Points
- **PyTorch Integration**: Customize `chimera_pytorch_integration.py` with your model architecture.
- **DSPy Orchestration**: Extend `chimera_dspy_orchestration.py` with custom predictors.
- **Error Logging**: Implement self-correction in `chimera_maml_error_logger.py`.
- **Dockerfile**: Adjust multi-stage build in `Dockerfile.multi-stage` for your environment.
- **Workflow**: Add advanced steps to `advanced_workflow_guide.maml.md`.
