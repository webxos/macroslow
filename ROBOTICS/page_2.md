Reputation-Based Validation: Customizable token-based reputation system

Quantum-Resistant Security: Post-quantum cryptography with liboqs and Qiskit

Prompt Injection Defense: Semantic analysis and jailbreak detection

# Markdown as Medium Language (MAML) more about the syntax:

Markdown as Medium Language: A protocol that extends the Markdown (.md) format into a structured, executable container for agent-to-agent communication. 

.maml.md: The official file extension for a MAML-compliant document. MAML Gateway: A runtime server that validates, routes, and executes the instructions within a MAML file. 

Desgined for MCP (Model Context Protocol): A protocol for tools and LLMs to communicate with external data sources. MAML is the ideal format for MCP servers to return rich, executable content. 

Examples of Front Matter: The mandatory YAML section at the top of a MAML file, enclosed by ---, containing machine-readable metadata. 

Examples of Content Body: The section of a MAML file after the front matter, using structured Markdown headers (##) to define content sections. 

Features Signed Execution Ticket: A cryptographic grant appended to a MAML file's History by a MAML Gateway, authorizing the execution of its code blocks.
