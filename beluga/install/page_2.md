## System Requirements

This page outlines the **system requirements** for deploying **MACROSLOW 2048** and its **BELUGA Agent**, a quantum-ready framework designed for advanced robotics, IoT, and quantum-classical computing. Built on the **PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES SDK** and integrated with the **CHIMERA 2048 SDK**, MACROSLOW 2048 leverages NVIDIA’s high-performance hardware ecosystem to support **LIDAR+SONAR** fusion via BELUGA’s **SOLIDAR™ engine**, **MAML/MU workflows**, and secure, scalable applications. These requirements ensure optimal performance for use cases like subterranean exploration, submarine operations, quantum IoT networks, and medical robotics. The specifications cover general, BELUGA-specific, and platform-specific needs, tailored for developers, researchers, and engineers.

### General Requirements

To run MACROSLOW 2048 and its components, your system must meet the following minimum requirements:

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher, ensuring compatibility with PyTorch, Qiskit, and SQLAlchemy.
- **Operating Systems**:
  - **Linux**: x86-64 or aarch64 (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Orin, DGX Spark).
  - **Windows**: x86-64 only (Windows on ARM is not fully supported).
- **NVIDIA GPU**:
  - Compute capability >= 6.1 (Pascal architecture or newer, e.g., GTX 1080, Jetson Orin Nano/AGX, A100/H100).
  - NVIDIA driver version 545 or newer, required for CUDA graph capture in CHIMERA 2048 workflows.
- **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit**: Version 12.2 or newer (optional for local compilation; not required for Dockerized environments but recommended for CUDA-Q and cuQuantum).
- **Docker**: Version 20.10 or higher for containerized deployment, enabling scalable setups with Kubernetes and Helm.
- **Storage**: Minimum 10GB free disk space for dependencies, datasets, quantum circuit simulations, and BELUGA’s sensor data processing.
- **Memory**: 16GB RAM minimum (32GB+ recommended for A100/H100 GPUs and large-scale LIDAR+SONAR datasets).
- **Network**: Stable internet connection (minimum 10 Mbps) for cloning repositories, accessing MCP gateways, and downloading dependencies.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Core libraries: `torch`, `sqlalchemy`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `qiskit`, `qiskit-aer`, `cuquantum`, `pyyaml`, `plotly`, `pydantic`, `requests`, `pynvml`, `prometheus_client`.
  - Installed via `requirements.txt` or `uv.lock` (detailed in Page 4).

**Note**: No local CUDA Toolkit installation is required if using Dockerized environments, as the MACROSLOW 2048 Dockerfile includes pre-configured CUDA support. However, for local development with CUDA-Q or cuQuantum, the toolkit is essential.

### BELUGA-Specific Requirements

The **BELUGA Agent**, designed for **LIDAR+SONAR** fusion via the **SOLIDAR™ engine**, has additional requirements to support real-time sensor processing and quantum graph databases:

- **Hardware**:
  - **NVIDIA Jetson Orin** (Nano or AGX): Provides up to 275 TOPS for edge AI, ideal for real-time LIDAR+SONAR processing in robotics and IoT applications.
  - **A100 or H100 GPUs**: Recommended for high-performance quantum simulations and distributed AI training, delivering up to 3,000 TFLOPS for BELUGA’s graph database operations.
  - **DGX Systems**: Optional for large-scale deployments, supporting planetary-scale IoT networks.
- **Sensors**:
  - **LIDAR**: Compatible modules like Velodyne HDL-32E or Ouster OS1, providing high-resolution point clouds (minimum 100,000 points/second).
  - **SONAR**: Compatible modules like Teledyne BlueView M900, supporting underwater imaging with 1–100 kHz frequency range.
  - **IoT Sensors**: Support for 9,600+ sensors (e.g., temperature, pressure) for integration with BELUGA’s IoT HIVE framework.
- **Memory**: 32GB+ RAM for processing large LIDAR+SONAR datasets (e.g., 1GB point clouds) and quantum graph databases.
- **Storage**: 20GB+ free for sensor data, logs, and fused graph outputs.
- **Software**:
  - **SOLIDAR™ Engine**: Included in BELUGA, requires `torch` and `sqlalchemy` for data fusion and storage.
  - **Qiskit and cuQuantum**: For quantum-enhanced processing of sensor data, ensuring 99% fidelity in simulations.
- **Network Bandwidth**: 50 Mbps+ for real-time streaming of LIDAR+SONAR data to MCP servers.

**Example Use Case**: For subterranean exploration, BELUGA requires a Jetson Orin AGX, a Velodyne LIDAR, and a BlueView SONAR to map cave systems with sub-100ms latency, storing fused data in a SQLAlchemy-managed `arachnid.db`.

### Platform-Specific Requirements

#### Linux aarch64 (ARM64, e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Orin, DGX Spark)
For BELUGA’s LIDAR+SONAR visualization and example workflows, install X11 development libraries to support rendering and visualization (e.g., Plotly for 3D ultra-graphs):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
