### CHIMERA 2048: Architectural Overview and Docker Context

**CHIMERA 2048** is a quantum powerhouse, comprising four **CHIMERA HEADS**‚Äîself-regenerative, CUDA-accelerated cores that collectively form a 2048-bit AES-equivalent security layer through four 512-bit AES keys. Each head serves a distinct function, enabling CHIMERA to handle complex MCP workflows:
- **HEAD_1 & HEAD_2**: Quantum engines powered by Qiskit, executing quantum circuits for tasks like cryptographic key distribution and variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) with sub-150ms latency.
- **HEAD_3 & HEAD_4**: AI engines driven by PyTorch, managing distributed model training and inference with up to 15 TFLOPS throughput.
- **MAML Gateway**: A FastAPI-based interface that processes `.maml.md` files, encoding workflows with YAML front matter, code blocks, and cryptographic signatures, validated by OCaml/Ortac for formal correctness.
- **Security Layer**: Combines 2048-bit AES-equivalent encryption, CRYSTALS-Dilithium post-quantum signatures, lightweight double tracing, and quadra-segment regeneration (rebuilding compromised heads in <5s).
- **Monitoring**: Integrates Prometheus for real-time tracking of CUDA utilization, system health, and workflow execution.

CHIMERA 2048 operates within the MCP framework, which facilitates agent-to-agent communication by encoding multidimensional data (context, intent, environment, history) in `.maml.ml` files. The `.mu` format, a reverse Markdown syntax (e.g., ‚ÄúHello‚Äù to ‚ÄúolleH‚Äù), supports error detection, digital receipts, and recursive ML training, ensuring workflow integrity. Dockerizing this system requires addressing its computational, security, and interoperability demands, optimized for NVIDIA hardware like Jetson Orin (275 TOPS for edge AI), A100/H100 GPUs (3,000 TFLOPS for HPC), and DGX systems.

### Docker Requirements for CHIMERA 2048

To containerize CHIMERA 2048, Dockerfiles must support a complex ecosystem of quantum, AI, and database components while maintaining security and scalability. Below are the key requirements, tailored for multi-stage builds:

1. **Base Image**:
   - **NVIDIA CUDA Base**: Use `nvidia/cuda:12.0.0-base-ubuntu22.04` or `nvidia/cuda:12.0.0-devel-ubuntu22.04` for CUDA support, ensuring compatibility with NVIDIA GPUs (sm_61 for Pascal, sm_80 for Ampere).
   - **Python 3.10+**: Required for Qiskit (0.45.0+), PyTorch (2.0.1+), and FastAPI, providing a unified runtime for quantum and AI workloads.
   - **Lightweight OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 minimizes image size while supporting CUDA and Python dependencies.

2. **Quantum Computing Dependencies**:

   - **Dependencies**: `pymongo`, `psycopg2-binary`, and `sqlalchemy-utils` for robust data handling.

5. **MAML and .mu Processing**:
   - **MAML Validator**: `maml_validator.py` compiles `.maml.md` files, ensuring schema compliance and executable code blocks (Python, Qiskit, OCaml).
   - **.mu Validator**: `mu_validator.py` processes reverse Markdown for error detection and digital receipts, supporting recursive ML training.
   - **MARKUP Agent**: A Chimera Head agent for converting `.maml.md` to `.mu`, generating shutdown scripts, and visualizing workflows with Plotly.
   - **Dependencies**: `pyyaml`, `pydantic`, and `ortac-runtime` for formal verification.

6. **FastAPI Gateway**:
   - **FastAPI and Uvicorn**: For serving MCP endpoints with <100ms latency, handling MAML file submissions and workflow execution.
   - **Dependencies**: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `requests`, and `pydantic` for API validation.

7. **Monitoring and Deployment**:
   - **Prometheus Client**: Tracks CUDA utilization, head status, and API performance, exposing metrics at `/metrics`.

### Multi-Stage Dockerfile Strategy

To meet these requirements, we adopt a **multi-stage Dockerfile** approach, dividing the build process into:
- **Builder Stage**: Installs dependencies, compiles MAML/.mu validators, and prepares artifacts.
- **Test Stage**: Runs unit tests on `.maml.ml` and `.mu` files, ensuring workflow integrity.
- **Production Stage**: Deploys a lean image with the FastAPI MCP server, Prometheus monitoring, and runtime dependencies.

This strategy minimizes image size, isolates build-time dependencies, and enhances security by excluding development tools from the production image. The Dockerfile will:
- Use `COPY --from` to transfer artifacts between stages.
- Leverage NVIDIA‚Äôs CUDA base images for GPU support.
- Configure environment variables via YAML for flexibility.
- Include health checks and Prometheus metrics for operational reliability.

### YAML Configuration for Docker

A `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates the CHIMERA 2048 deployment, defining services for the FastAPI gateway, database, and Prometheus. A sample structure:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  chimera:
    image: chimera-2048:latest
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: chimera_hybrid_dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
      - "9090:9090"
    environment:
      - MARKUP_DB_URI=postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/chimera
      - MARKUP_QUANTUM_ENABLED=true
      - MARKUP_API_HOST=0.0.0.0
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              capabilities: [gpu]
  db:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass
      - POSTGRES_DB=chimera
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:v2.37.0
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

This YAML ensures GPU access, database connectivity, and monitoring, aligning with CHIMERA‚Äôs requirements for low-latency, high-throughput operations.
