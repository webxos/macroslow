# üêâ CHIMERA 2048-AES Homelab: Page 4 ‚Äì Hardware Assembly Guide

This page provides step-by-step instructions to assemble your **CHIMERA 2048-AES Homelab** for Budget (~$500), Mid-Tier (~$1,500), or High-End (~$5,000+) builds. Follow the steps tailored to your chosen configuration, ensuring proper component integration for NVIDIA GPUs, Raspberry Pi, and supporting hardware.

## üõ†Ô∏è Assembly Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Workspace
- **Requirements**: Clean, well-lit area; anti-static wrist strap; screwdrivers (Phillips #2, flathead); thermal paste; cable ties.
- **Environment**: Maintain 15‚Äì25¬∞C to avoid thermal issues during assembly.
- **Safety**: Unplug all power sources before starting.

### 2. Assemble the Core Compute Unit
- **Budget Build (Jetson Nano + Raspberry Pi 4)**:
  1. Mount Jetson Nano on a passive heatsink; apply thermal paste to GPU chip.
  2. Secure Raspberry Pi 4 to a 3D-printed enclosure with active fan.
  3. Connect Jetson Nano to power (5V/4A barrel) and Pi to USB-C (5V/3A).
- **Mid-Tier Build (Jetson AGX Orin + 3x Raspberry Pi 5)**:
  1. Install Jetson AGX Orin in enclosure with 40mm active cooling fans.
  2. Mount 3x Raspberry Pi 5 on a cluster frame with aluminum heatsinks.
  3. Connect Orin to 12V/5A power and each Pi to USB-C (5V/3A).
- **High-End Build (RTX A6000/A100 + 5x Raspberry Pi 5)**:
  1. Install GPU in 4U rackmount chassis with liquid cooling loop.
  2. Mount 5x Raspberry Pi 5 in a rackmount cluster tray with active cooling.
  3. Connect GPU to 850W PSU and each Pi to USB-C (5V/3A).

### 3. Set Up Storage
- **Budget Build**:
  - Insert 128GB microSD into Jetson Nano and Pi 4.
  - Connect 500GB USB SSD to Jetson via USB 3.0.
- **Mid-Tier Build**:
  - Install 256GB NVMe SSD in each Pi 5 (via PCIe adapter).
  - Connect 1TB USB SSD to Jetson AGX Orin.
- **High-End Build**:
  - Install 4TB PCIe NVMe SSD in server chassis for GPU.
  - Equip each Pi 5 with 1TB NVMe SSD.

### 4. Configure Networking
- **Budget Build**: Connect Jetson Nano and Pi 4 to a 4-port Gigabit Ethernet switch.
- **Mid-Tier Build**: Link Jetson AGX Orin and 3x Pi 5 to an 8-port Gigabit switch.
- **High-End Build**: Connect GPU server and 5x Pi 5 to a 16-port Gigabit switch with PoE.
- **Cables**: Use Cat6 Ethernet cables; configure VLANs for IoT segmentation.

### 5. Cooling and Cable Management
- **Cooling**:
  - Budget: Ensure passive heatsink and fan are secure; check airflow.
  - Mid-Tier: Verify 40mm fans are operational; monitor GPU/Pi temps.
  - High-End: Test liquid cooling loop for GPU; ensure Pi fans are running.
- **Cable Management**: Use cable ties to organize power, USB, and Ethernet cables; avoid airflow obstruction.

### 6. Power Up and Initial Checks
- **Power Connections**:
  - Budget: Connect Jetson (barrel) and Pi (USB-C) to power.
  - Mid-Tier: Connect Orin (12V) and Pis (USB-C) to power.
  - High-End: Plug server PSU into UPS; connect Pis to USB-C.
- **Initial Boot**:
  - Attach HDMI monitor and keyboard to Jetson/Pi for initial setup.
  - Verify all components power on; check for POST errors or LED indicators.

### 7. Final Assembly
- Secure all components in enclosure (3D-printed for Budget, rackmount for Mid/High-End).
- Double-check connections for GPU, Pis, storage, and networking.
- Close enclosure, ensuring no loose screws or cables.

## üí° Tips for Successful Assembly
- **Thermal Management**: Apply thermal paste sparingly; ensure fans/heatsinks are dust-free.
- **Component Compatibility**: Verify GPU power requirements match PSU capacity.
- **Organization**: Label cables and ports for easy troubleshooting.
- **Testing**: Power on one component at a time to isolate potential issues.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls
- **Overheating**: Ensure adequate cooling; monitor temps during initial boot.
- **Loose Connections**: Tighten all screws and connectors to avoid intermittent issues.
- **Power Mismatch**: Confirm voltage/amperage for GPU and Pi power supplies.
