With **2048-bit AES-equivalent encryption** and **NVIDIA CUDA optimization**, your homelab will unlock groundbreaking applications‚Äîfrom quantum-enhanced machine learning to real-time IoT orchestration‚Äîall from the comfort of your home. üê™

## üåü Introduction: A Quantum Leap for Homelabs

The **CHIMERA 2048-AES Homelab** is more than a server; it‚Äôs a gateway to the future of computing. Built on the **MACROSLOW ecosystem**, CHIMERA 2048 integrates four computational cores‚Äîtwo powered by **Qiskit** for quantum circuits and two by **PyTorch** for AI‚Äîdelivering sub-150ms quantum latency and up to 15 TFLOPS of AI throughput. Paired with Raspberry Pi for edge tasks, this homelab supports secure, scalable workflows for scientific research, AI development, and IoT sensor fusion, all protected by quantum-resistant cryptography.

This guide provides a step-by-step blueprint to construct your homelab, offering three build configurations to suit different budgets and goals:
- **Budget Build (~$500)**: Uses NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi 4 for affordable quantum and AI experimentation.
- **Mid-Tier Build (~$1,500)**: Leverages Jetson AGX Orin and multiple Raspberry Pi 5s for enhanced performance and IoT scalability.
- **High-End Build (~$5,000+)**: Combines NVIDIA RTX A6000/A100 GPUs with a Raspberry Pi cluster for professional-grade quantum and AI workloads.

Each configuration is optimized for the **CHIMERA 2048 SDK**, enabling you to run **MAML workflows**, deploy **FastAPI gateways**, and integrate **BELUGA Agent** for IoT tasks. Whether you‚Äôre simulating quantum circuits, training AI models, or managing sensor networks, this homelab brings the power of **PROJECT DUNES** to your desk.
