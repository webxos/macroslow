## Introduction to Quantitative Conservation
Quantitative conservation is a cornerstone of secure, efficient, and reliable computational systems, ensuring that data, assets, and interactions remain uncompromised. This principle can be used to underpin a new innovative system: the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This system can harness quantum-resistant cryptography, multi-agent architectures, and the **.MAML** (Markdown as Medium Language) syntax to deliver scalable, auditable, and secure operations. This ten-page guide provides a comprehensive framework for developers to implement quantitative conservation, fostering trust and robustness in AI-driven and decentralized environments.

The MCP ensures that AI models, such as large language models (LLMs), maintain accurate and complete context during interactions, optimizing resource use and preventing data corruption. It employs measurable metrics like token efficiency and tool call success rates to quantify context integrity. Conversely, the DUNE system, a decentralized exchange framework, focuses on asset integrity through cryptographic invariants and transparent metrics like Total Value Locked (TVL). By addressing both systems, this guide equips developers with practical strategies to maintain system integrity, enhance efficiency, and build trust through auditable processes. The following sections outline the content of each page:
