# Introduction to MAML

## Role in MACROSLOW

MAML (Markdown as Medium Language) is a Markdown-based protocol for defining executable workflows in the 2048 AES Suite SDK. Integrated with Model Context Protocol, it supports secure, federated data archiving for astrobotany and quantum linguistics, enhancing space research and sustainable technologies.

### Objectives
- **Workflow Automation**: Define tasks with YAML front matter and structured sections.
- **Interoperability**: Standardize workflows for global collaboration.
- **Quantum Readiness**: Support Qiskit and CUDA for advanced processing.
- **Security**: Leverage Quantum 2048-bit AES encryption for data protection.

### Role in SDK
MAML orchestrates workflows for astrobotany experiments and quantum linguistic analysis, while MCP backed archives main secure data calling. Together, they enable researchers to process NASA/SpaceX size data and deploy it on MCP servers.
